# gpt-edge
This is a repo that makes Large Language Models available for everyone who would like to experiment with this new emergent technology. The project is possible thanks to GGML and Enigma Virtual Box. If you have used realesrgan-vulkan binaries you will love this project!

### Available binaries

- [x] [gpt-2](https://github.com/appvoid/gpt-edge/releases/download/gpt-2/gpt-2.exe)
- [ ] gpt-j
- [ ] llama

### Keep in mind that...
It's important to note that I'm releasing the base models, which are not finetuned nor aligned in any way. So use with caution for user-facing apps.
